## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Architecture (Node.js) - To Be Implemented

**Target Structure:**
```javascript
backend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/     # Handle HTTP requests/responses
â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/   # Database access layer
â”œâ”€â”€ models/         # Data models/schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/     # Auth, validation, error handling
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/         # API route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Helper functions
â””â”€â”€ config/         # Database, environment config
```

**Current Status**: Backend not implemented - only `db-schema.sql` exists

#### Key Controllers:
- `AuthController` - Login, registration, password management
- `UserController` - User CRUD operations
- `SiteController` - Site management
- `ReportController` - Daily/weekly/WHS reports
- `PhotoController` - Image upload and management
- `LeaveController` - Leave request management

#### Key Services:
- `UserService` - User business logic
- `SiteService` - Site assignment and management
- `ReportService` - Report generation and processing
- `NotificationService` - Email/in-app notifications
- `FileService` - Photo/document handling

### Database Schema Considerations

**Primary Schema File**: `db-schema.sql` (located in project root)

**Current Implementation**: Production-ready PostgreSQL schema with:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with company isolation
- UUID-based primary keys for scalability
- Comprehensive indexes and constraints
- Role-based access control (admin, site_manager, worker, client)
- Complete construction management entities:
  - Site and project management with GPS tracking
  - Daily/weekly/WHS reporting systems
  - Tool and equipment tracking with assignments
  - Leave management workflows
  - In-app messaging and notifications
  - Document management with versioning
  - Activity logging and audit trails
  - Subscription and billing management

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Route protection middleware
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file upload handling

### File Storage Strategy
- **MVP**: Supabase buckets (1GB free tier) - Not yet implemented
- **Future**: Migrate to Amazon S3 for scalability
- **Organization**: `company_id/site_id/date/photos/`
- **Features Needed**: Image optimization, compression, thumbnail generation

### Current Component Structure
```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ landing/      # Landing page components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ login/        # Authentication components (UI only)
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (landing)/    # Landing page routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (no-navbar)/ # Auth pages (login, signup)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (navbar)/    # Main application routes
â””â”€â”€ lib/             # Utility functions
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Mobile-first**: Many workers will use phones

- **Technical Performance**: Page load times, uptime

## Integration Considerations
- **Email Notifications**: For missing reports, leave approvals
- **SMS Alerts**: Critical updates (optional)
- **Payroll Systems**: Export hours for payroll processing
- **Cloud Storage**: Scalable file storage solution
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database and file backups

## Important Notes for Development

1. **Project Status**: Frontend is implemented, backend needs to be built from scratch
2. **Database Schema**: Always refer to `db-schema.sql` - it's production-ready with comprehensive business rules
3. **Development Commands**: See `CLAUDE.md` for current npm scripts and development workflow
4. **Authentication**: Currently UI-only - backend integration is the next major milestone
5. **Design System**: Uses shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS - maintain consistency with existing components
6. **User Experience First**: Every feature should prioritize ease of use for less tech-savvy construction workers
7. **Performance**: Fast loading is crucial for adoption
8. **Mobile-First**: Many users will access via phones on construction sites
9. **Australian Focus**: Designed for AUS/NZ construction industry (timezone, currency, regulations)
10. **Feedback Loop**: Plan for continuous improvement based on user feedback

This MVP should establish a strong foundation for a scalable, user-friendly construction management platform that can compete effectively in the AUS/NZ market.
